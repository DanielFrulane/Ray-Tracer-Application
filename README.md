# Ray-Tracer-Application

This is an ongoing project for the implementation of Ray Tracing in C++ using SDL, Eigen, opencv and rapidjason.

Functionalities were implemented with the tutorial made by QuantitativeBytes on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3WoIG-PLjSt54LvzY2SuBQDl-cXa11Tm

I'm currently coding an UI for the application and will provide the documentation right after.

The final project and documentation should be available until the end of 02/2024.
